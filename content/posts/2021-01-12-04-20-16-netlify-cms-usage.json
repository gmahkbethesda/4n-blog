  "body": "I integrated Netlify CMS into this template because its convinience and simplicity. The UI is editor-friendly and only take 1 or 2 minutes to get used to. It also has a workflow to manage drafts, review posts and publishing. If you have teammates that help you with blogging, you can invite them too. All your posts will be saved into your Github repository with `json` format which is a no-brain solution, also, you can immigrate to other platforms quickly.\n\nLet's say your website is at `https://your-website-name.netlify.app`, go to `https://your-website-name.netlify.app/admin` and log in with your admin account\n\n::: info\nFor developers: If you run this project locally, you still can open CMS page at `localhost:3000/admin` and use the same admin account (network required). Your posts will be saved in your Github repository, not your local folder (you should pull commits after writting)\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Table of contents\n\n[toc]\n\n## Pages\n\nThis is where you manage your single pages\n> ![Pages](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610427384/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Netlify%20CMS%20usage/pages_uddl6f.png \"Pages\")\n\n::: info\nWhen you edit page, no need to fill in `Author name` and `Author avatar` fields. These information can be set in `Settings > Setting`.\n:::\n\n### Index\n\nThis is your home page\n::: error\n**DO NOT** delete `Index` page\n:::\n\nMany people like showing all posts in their home page but because we have many categories so instead of displaying everything, I put posts in their corresponding page. The home page now should be used as an introduction, you can highlight some of your proudest posts here.\n\n### Other pages\n\nYou can create as many as pages you want. They will be shown up on the navigation bar (or side bar if there are too many stuffs)\n\nIf your page name is `About me`, the URL to this page is `https://your-website-name.netlify.app/about-me`\n\n## Categories\n\nThis is where you manage your categories\n> ![Categories](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610427384/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Netlify%20CMS%20usage/categories_vmryfr.png \"Categories\")\n\nYou can create as many as categories you want. They will be shown up on the navigation bar (or side bar if there are too many stuffs)\n\nIf your category name is `blog`, the URL to this category is `https://your-website-name.netlify.app/blog`\n\n## Posts\n\nThis collections contains all posts (from all categories).\n\nWhen you create a post, you should choose at least one category this post belongs to.\nFor example, you create a post `My first post` for `Blog` category, it will be displayed in `https://your-website-name.netlify.app/blog/2021-01-01-00-00-00-my-first-post`. \n> *`2021-01-01-00-00-00` is just a date time string when you create this post.*\n\n::: info\nYou don't need to fill in `Author name` and `Author avatar` fields. These information can be set in `Settings > Setting`.\n:::\n\n## Settings\n\nAll blog settings live here.\n\n::: error\n**DO NOT** delete anything!\n:::\n\nPlease refer to [Advanced blog settings](/tutorials/2021-01-11-02-13-11-advanced-blog-settings) for more information.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. When you create a category/page/post, you will see `UNSAVED CHANGES` in the upper left corner. This means you should click that `Save` button\n> ![Unsaved changes](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610437845/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Netlify%20CMS%20usage/Unsaved_changes_bm0via.png \"Unsaved changes\")\n\n2. Once saved, it will be kept with `Draft` status. You can find your draft in [Workflow](/admin/#/workflow) section. You can change its status to `Review` or `Ready` by dragging it to corresponding columns\n\n3. To publish, your draft status must be set to `Ready`. Click `Publish` button\n> ![Publish](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610437894/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Netlify%20CMS%20usage/Publish_zsxhuw.png \"Publish\")\n\n## Preview\n\nAfter you save a post (not publish yet), Netlify will create a preview version in about 1 minute. You can check for preview link and open a web page with that link to see your content.\n> ![Check for preview](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610438860/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Netlify%20CMS%20usage/Check_for_preview_kvinpg.png \"Check for preview\")\n\n::: warning\nAlthough I enable this feature, it doesn't work as my expectation because of dynamic category mechanic. You can still use it to preview category/page before publish. To preview post, after you click preview link, in the URL, you must change '/posts/' to its category such as '/blog/' and open that new URL.\n:::\n\n--- \n\n## Credits\n[Jumbotron image](https://unsplash.com/photos/3GZNPBLImWc) by [NeONBRAND](https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/blog?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)",
