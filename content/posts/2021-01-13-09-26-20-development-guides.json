Your site will be exported to `dist/` folder\n``` bash\nnpm run generate\n```\n\n#### Serve static site\nServe the `dist/` directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying.\n``` bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\nFor more information, please read https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/commands#target-static\n\n### Analyze\nThis will visualize your bundles and show you libraries' size.\n``` bash\nnpm run analyze\n```\n\n---\n## Project development\nThis project use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), please check their documentations if my simple guide is not enough for you.\n\n### Config Netlify CMS\nFor full documentation, please visit https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/\nEdit `static/admin/config.yml` to change Netlify CMS for example adding more settings, change default value for fields, ...\n\n### Content\nIf you create something with Netlify CMS and publish it, everything will saved in `content/` directory inside your repository, not your local directory. You must pull commits from Github after editing.\n\n### Resources\nResources should be put in `static/` directory. \nThere is a `img/` folder inside `static/` for image assets. When you want to use an image for your `img` element, you can set `src=\"/img/logo.png\"`\n\n### Pages\nhttps://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/pages\nEverything inside `pages/` directory should be a single page. I implemented dynamic page and sub-page mechanic so this directory is simple as below:\n![Page directory](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610594457/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Tutorials/Development%20guides/page_directory_mevh9v.png \"Page directory\")\n\n#### index.vue\nThis is the home page. It loads data from `content/pages/index.json`. You can change `index.json` by using Netlify CMS or replace this page completely by modifying my old code.\n\n#### _slug.vue\nThis is dynamic page that renders level 1 pages. \nEverytime you vist a level 1 page (e.g `https://your-website-name.com/blog` or `https://your-website-name.com/about-me`), slug of this page will be extracted (`blog`, `about-me`). Then it will try to find file with path `content/pages/${this.slug}.json` or `content/categories/${this.slug}.json`. Depend on which file is found, page will render correspondingly.\n- For single page from `content/pages`: show file content.\n- For category page from `content/categories`: list all posts belong to this category.\n\n#### _categories/_slug.vue\nThis is dynamic page that renders level 2 pages (posts of categories).\nWhen you visit `https://your-website-name.com/blog/post`, slug `post` will be extracted (category name like `blog` can be exported too but it's not important). A file with path `content/posts/${this.slug}.json` should exist and page will load data from this file.\n\n### Generate static pages for all routes\nBecause I have dynamic routes level 2 pages so when generate static site, I must map each file from `content/posts/` with its route.\nPlease see file `nuxt.config.js`, `generate` attribute. Basically, I get all available category names, all post information and check which post belong to which category and generate route with post data as payload. Payload will be used later inside `asyncData` function of `_categories/_slug.vue`\n\n### Vuex\nStore data for this site: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/\nImplementation is in `store/index.js`. Data stored can be used inside any Vue component.\n\n### Blog settings\nCheck `store/index.js`.\nWhen Nuxt server initializes, it load settings from `content/settings/setting.json`.\nYou can create many other settings by changing `static/admin/config.yml` then load them with Vuex's `actions`.\n\n### Navigation bar\nCheck `store/index.js`.\nWhen Nuxt server initializes, it load all categories from `content/categories/` and all single pages from `content/pages` to create a list of level 1 pages. \n`TopBar` component will load level 1 pages and render navigations for you site.\n\n### Markdown parser\nI created a simple version of `markdown-it-vue` called [markdown-it-vue-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-vue-minify) without charts and Font Awesome because these packages are really heavy.\nThere are still some [issues](https://github.com/cvtung/markdown-it-vue-minify/issues), please help me fix them and maintain this package! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n---\n\n## Credits\n[Jumbotron image](https://unsplash.com/photos/EzSyFRfNP_c) by [Yancy Min](https://unsplash.com/@yancymin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/construction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)",
