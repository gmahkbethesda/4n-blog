  "body": "This guide is for everyone. Simple and easy to follow\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n[toc]\n\n## Prequisite\n\n* A [Github](https://github.com/) account to save template code and your writing content\n* A [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account to host your static website and deploy update after you've done with writting\n\n## Deployment\n\n1. Click this link [Deploy to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cvtung/4N-powerful-blog-template&stack=cms)\n\n   > ![Deploy to Netlify](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610159150/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Getting%20started/deploy_to_Netlify_lkoh7u.png \"Deploy to Netlify\")\n2. Connect your Github account with Netlify\n3. Name your Github repository (a place where this template code and your website content are stored) with something else than the default name such as `my-blog`, ... It's also recommended to choose a unique name that you never use for your other repository.\n\n   > ![Name your Github repository](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610159285/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Getting%20started/Name_your_Github_repository_jxms4j.png \"Name your Github repository\")\n4. Click `Save & Deploy` button\n5. Please wait until your site available. Netlify will be generating a static website from the template code in your repository. Modifying anything in `Site settings` sections is not recommended. Your site can be found at `https://random-website-name.netlify.app`\n\n   > ![Site is being deployed](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610159409/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Getting%20started/Netlify_site_is_being_deployed_cqj15y.png \"Site is being deployed\")\n   >\n   > > You will may receive an invitation email from Netlify to create a new admin user to manage your site but you should **NOT** click it for now\n   > > ![Netlify invitation email](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610158920/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Getting%20started/invitation_email_kag3ii.jpg \"Netlify invitation email\")\n\n## Create an admin user\n\n1. Once your site is deployed, check your email for invitation link.\n2. Enter a password in Sign up form. From now on, you can go to `https://random-website-name.netlify.app/admin` and log in with your email and password to manage all contents and settings\n\n   > ![Enter a password](https://res.cloudinary.com/tungcv/image/upload/v1610164643/4N%20Powerful%20Blog%20Template/Getting%20started/Enter_a_password_etxnnp.png \"Enter a password\")\n\n## Site setting\n\nAll configurations should be performed after deployment finishes. You can go to `Site settings` in your Netlify site\n\n* **General > Change site name**:  use a memorable name rather than old given random name such as `https://your-website-name.netlify.app`.\n\n  > You should only change your site name after creating an admin user otherwise the invitation link is not accesible anymore and you have to modify the website name in that link to make it available again :roll_eyes:\n* **Domain management**:  if you already bought a domain e.g `https://your-website-name.com`, you can point it to your Netlify site now. You still can add `/admin` after your website URL to manage everything\n\n## Blog setting\n\nLet's say your website is at `https://your-website-name.netlify.app`, go to `https://your-website-name.netlify.app/admin` and log in with your admin account\n\n1. Navigate to `Collections > Settings`. This will show a list of your blog settings\n2. Open `General` page\n3. Change default field values:\n`WEBSITE_NAME`: your blog name\n`JUMBOTRON`: a large image on the top of the home page\n`LOGO`: your blog logo\n`AUTHOR_NAME`: your name here\n`AUTHOR_AVATAR`: your avatar\n`DESCRIPTION`: some words describe your blog\n\n::: warning\nIf you see some other fields, that means I've added some new settings. You can check [Advanced blog settings tutorial](/tutorials/2021-01-11-02-13-11-advanced-blog-settings) for more advanced configuration :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\n:::\n\n---\n## Credits\n[Jumbotron image](https://unsplash.com/photos/_uM5_nG2ssc) by [Gia Oris](https://unsplash.com/@giabyte?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/start?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)",
