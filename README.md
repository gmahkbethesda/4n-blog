This project is one of my experiments with JAM stack. You can learn more about JAM stack here: https://jamstack.org.
I was about to build a new personal blog only which should be as simple as possible and I ended up with crafting a new template because I couldn't find any [template](https://templates.netlify.com/) that satisfies my requirements. It took me few weeks to study, write guiding stuffs, ... but it was fun and worth my while. Hope you like it too.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why was this template named as 4N?

> It was built with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) framework, styled with made-by-me [Notion](notion.so/)-liked theme, uses [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage content and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Why should I use Netlify CMS as a content management system?

> Because it's convinient. If you want to write/edit/delete posts anywhere (even on your phone), you can go to `https://your-blog-name.com/admin`, log in and do whatever you want.

### I'm a non-tech user, can I still use it?

> Sure. This template is a ready-to-use blog. The only things you need to do is to register a [Github](https://github.com/) account and a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account (all free) and click a some magic buttons, everything will be ready in 5 minutes (no kidding :sunglasses:). Please read [Getting started](https://4n-powerful-blog-template.netlify.app/getting-started) page and [Tutorials](https://4n-powerful-blog-template.netlify.app/tutorials) category for more information.

### Please explain more ... :cry:

> When you decide to click [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cvtung/4N-powerful-blog-template&stack=cms), Netlify will copy this template source code into your Github account, start generating a static website from code and host that site for you automatically. After few minutes, your site will be ready at `https://your-netlify-site-name.netlify.com`, you can go to `https://your-netlify-site-name.netlify.com/admin` and tweak. From now on, all content you publish will be saved in your Github account and Netlify will update your site with your new content automatically. Normally, it only takes 1 minute to refresh your site after you finish writing.
